# Ford GoBike System Data
### By: Temidayo Akindileni

## OVERVIEW OF DATASET
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. There are 174,952 observations and 9 features.
The features include:
*	A unique bike ID for each bicycle
*	Duration of trip in seconds
*	The start and end time of each trip
*	The beginning and end station ID, latitude, longitude, and station name
*	User’s year of birth
*	User’s gender
*	whether the user has a subscription to the service or not
Before the commencement of analysis, I performed some data wrangling. Some of which were:
*	Removing some unnecessary columns not needed for the analysis.
*	Dropping of null values.
*	Changing of wrong datatypes.
*	Creating new calculated columns.
*	Extracting weekdays and time from date column

## SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS
From the analysis made, here are some conclusions I made:
*	Majority of the users (91%) have subscriptions.
*	There are more males among the users.
*	Most trips occur on Thursday evenings
*	Users between ages 25 and 35 took the highest no of trips
*	Customers took longer trips than subscribers.
*	Females set out in the morning earlier than males.

## INSIGHTS IN PRESENTATION
In this project, my focus was on how subscribers and customers made use of Ford GoBike services in terms of when they use the service and how long their trips lasted.
